# Insider's Teeter Totter Challenge


## Disclaimer


I decided to do this assignment with vanilla Javascript and no framework/libraries for both JS or CSS, because _why not!?_

So to simplify, I decided to use some _modern_ features that are either not supported, or with partial support on IE11:
- [import](https://caniuse.com/?search=import)
- [let](https://caniuse.com/let)/[const](https://caniuse.com/const)
- [string literals](https://caniuse.com/template-literals)
- [arrow functions](https://caniuse.com/arrow-functions)
- [CSS variables](https://caniuse.com/css-env-function)

Any relative modern browser (2018+) should be able to run the challenge. 

2 + 1.5 * 1

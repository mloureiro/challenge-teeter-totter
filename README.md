# Insider's Teeter Totter Challenge


## Remarks

General: 
- code is VCS through git 

Javascript wise:
- started with Vanilla JS then I noticed (almost at the bottom of the rules) that Vuex is a requirement, and add to change the app (maybe for next candidates, it would be great to have the required technologies right on top)

Regarding CSS:
- I'm using an adapted version of the [ABEM nomenclature](https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/)
- to help with the ABEM format, I've actually used SASS (although only for the purpose of having the nested hierarchy)
- for variables/themes I'm using [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) ([spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/)) that are [not supported on IE11](https://caniuse.com/css-variables)
